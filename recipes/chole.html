        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This chickpea dish, also referred to as chana masala, gets its deep, robust flavor from simmering together aromatic spices like anise pods, cloves, and garam masala. 
            Serve with naan and basmati rice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>2 star anise pods</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chile powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 whole clove, or more to taste</li>
          </ul>          
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Sauté onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, and star anise. Continue to sauté until just fragrant. Add chickpeas, tomato sauce, water, chile powder, garam masala, salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and clove. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until chickpeas start to soften, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mash some chickpeas directly in the pot to give sauce a chunkier consistency. Cover and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 15 minutes. Remove star anise and clove before serving.</li>
        </ol>
